Summary of Use Case Diagram  from the README:

The backend for the Airbnb Clone supports several key use cases, primarily categorized under User Authentication, Property Management, Booking System, and Payments.

User Authentication Use Cases: Users can register new accounts, log in securely to access the platform, log out of their sessions, view and update their profile information, and reset their passwords if forgotten.

Property Management Use Cases: Hosts can list new properties with comprehensive details including location, amenities, pricing, and availability. They also have the ability to edit and manage their existing listings. Users (primarily guests) can search for properties based on various criteria and view detailed information about specific properties. They can also check the availability of a property for their desired dates.

Booking System Use Cases: Authenticated guests can make booking requests for available properties. Both guests and hosts can view their booking history and details. The system also supports booking modifications (if implemented) and cancellations, potentially subject to defined policies.

Payments Use Cases: The backend integrates with a payment gateway to process payments initiated by guests for their bookings. It also provides functionality to check the status of a payment and may include features for handling refunds or payouts to hosts.

In essence, the backend is designed to handle the core interactions between guests and hosts on the platform, from initial user management and property discovery to booking and payment processing.
